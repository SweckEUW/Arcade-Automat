I created this application together with a fellow student for the course Algorithms and Datastructures. We had to implement certain algorithms of the course and we decided to make this little Arcade Automat which features the games Pac-Man and Snake. We used merge and heap sort to sort a high score list, the A* path finding algorithm in the pacman game and a binary search algorithm to search for names inside the high score list.
