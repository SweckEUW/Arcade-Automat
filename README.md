This Application was created for a Data Structures & Algorithms course, where we implemented algorithms, which were taught at the Lecture. We decided to make the classic arcade Automate games Pac-Man and Snake. We used Merge- and Heap-Sort to sort high score table, the A* search algorithm for the Ghosts in Pac-Man and a binary search algorithm to search for Names inside the high score table.
